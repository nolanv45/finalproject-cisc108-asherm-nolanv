Title:
**MOUNTAIN CLIMBER**


**DESCRIPTION**:
- Our game is a scroller where the player is climbing a mountain and must dodge obstacles along the way with the goal of surviving for as long as possible.

**ABOUT**:

- Our game has the player **scale** a mountain and obtain a high score based on how high they climb. Players can gain 
lives when they collide with randomly spawning hearts, but lose lives when colliding with boulders, falling down slightly. When
player collides with the bottom of the screen, it is an instant game over and player ends with their current score. Camera will
move with the player as they climb up. A player's high score is determined based on how long they are able to survive without either
falling down to the bottom of the screen or losing all their lives. Players will also have a set limit of up to a maximum of three hearts.
